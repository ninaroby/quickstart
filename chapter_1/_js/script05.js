// The confirm method() takes one parameter (the question you want to ask) and returns either true or false, depending on the users response.  When the use clicks ok it returns a true value and when they click cancel it returns false.

confirm(("Are you sure you want to do that")) ? alert("You said yes!") : alert("You said no"); // shorthand way to do the same as the above, commented out Javascript.
